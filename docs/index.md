# EJ Pickle.

coming soon...

#### About how the Pickle part came to be.

So, one day, when I was just five Dad asked me to choose a name for him to call me.
Me: "Pickle."
Dad: "OK Pickle. What do you want Pickle, what do you like Pickle?"
Me: "No no no no no, stop it!!!"
## One Year Later
Dad: "What do you want your MineCraft username to be?"
Me: "I don't know."
##### Quick little bit about the EJ part.
My initals happen to be EJR.
#### How I got my username
So Dad asked if i wanted my username to be ejpickle.
"No no no!!" I said.
I did not want my username to have anything to do with "Pickle"
"OK then what do you want it to be?"
"Uhhhhhhhhhh..."
"OK, it's gonna be ejpickle."
"No no no WAIT!!!"
"Too late now"
